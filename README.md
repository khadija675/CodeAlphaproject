# 📊 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship** at **CodeAlpha**.  
It focuses on **web scraping**, **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **data visualization** using Python.

---

## 🧩 Tasks Completed
### ✅ Task 1: Web Scraping
- Used **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** to scrape data from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/).
- Extracted book **Title**, **Price**, and **Rating** across 10 pages.
- Saved the dataset as `books_data.csv`.

### ✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored dataset structure and data types using **Pandas**.
- Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
- Converted textual ratings (e.g., “Four”) into numeric values.

### ✅ Task 3: Data Visualization
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create:
  - Count plot of books by rating  
  - Price distribution histogram  
  - Box plot comparing price vs. rating
- Derived insights about book trends and price patterns.

## 🧮 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- BeautifulSoup  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Requests

## 📈 Key Insights
- Most books have **3–4 star ratings**.  
- Average book price is between **£35–£40**.  
- Rating doesn’t strongly influence price — prices are fairly balanced across all ratings.  
- Cleaned and structured dataset ready for further analysis or dashboarding.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Created from public website: [books.toscrape.com](https://books.toscrape.com/)  
- Saved locally as `books_data.csv`
